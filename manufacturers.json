Specifically tailored for humanitarian intervention the HIPS line might lack some firepower compared to the offering of other manufacturers but offers unique systems others would have deemed too cumbersome for installation on mechanised chassis as well as highly advanced systems, some even developed in Unions joined program with Harrisonâ€™s Think Tank.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Lanika is the fastest growing supplier of military hardware in all of the Rosergaard pillar. The rapid success of the young start-up has led to many rumours about its origins. Some called it a deniable black-market asset of SSC, others call it a money laundering operation of the organised underworld suspecting the tech to be previously used for smuggling while even Horus and the adherents of Ra have been connected to the company in wild conspiracy theories. Still Lanika proves resilient even after claims of assets stolen from the local Voladore and they remain the cheapest producers of frames within Lancer quality standards.</p>"
