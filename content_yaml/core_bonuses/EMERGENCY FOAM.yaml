description: Detonating frames are reportedly the cause for over half the collateral
  damage in contemporary urban warfare causing untold suffering completely preventable
  through better safety practice.
effect: Your frame can no longer be fully destroyed, deploying a hardening foam screen that prevents uncontrollable damage. You will always be able to repair your mech given enough rest and the necessary Repair Cap (2 per Structure). Undestroyed systems will always be salvageable.
