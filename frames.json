Without limiters, the weapon gains ordonance status but its range is raised to line 15 and the damage increases to 16-range. It also melts all ground in a burst 3 area additionally to your full line 15. It can only be fired once in this mode and reverts  back to normal operation automatically afterwards.</p>",
